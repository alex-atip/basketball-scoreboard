## 🏙️ About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Scrimba FullStack Career Path**.  
It’s a simple **basketball scoreboard** built from scratch, following the original **Figma design** provided in the course.

The goal was to practice **DOM manipulation**, **state updates**, and **event handling** in JavaScript while also focusing on layout accuracy, component spacing, and visual clarity.

The scoreboard displays points for **Home** and **Guest** teams, and each team has three buttons to increase the score by **+1**, **+2**, or **+3** points.

## 💡 What I Learned

* Updating the DOM using JavaScript
* Managing UI state using variables
* Adding **event listeners** to multiple buttons
* Displaying and updating numeric values in real time
* Practicing **pixel-perfect UI reproduction** from a Figma design
* Working with **Flexbox** for layout and alignment
* Deploying projects to **Netlify**

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I am reinforcing my **core frontend fundamentals** — focusing first on **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** before moving deeper into more advanced stacks like **TypeScript, React, and backend development**.

This simple but practical project helped strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the UI in real time and how to structure small interactive components.

If you'd like to **give feedback or a code review**, I’d love to hear from you! 🙌
