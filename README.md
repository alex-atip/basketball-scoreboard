## 🏙️ About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Scrimba FullStack Career Path**.  
It’s a simple **basketball scoreboard** built from scratch, following the original **Figma design** from the course.

I reproduced the layout and wired seven buttons:
- **+1 / +2 / +3 (Home)**
- **+1 / +2 / +3 (Guest)**
- **New Game** (resets both scores to zero)

Design details include a dark panel, **7-segment-style** numbers using a custom font, and subtle shadows to mirror the Figma aesthetic.

## 💡 What I Learned

* Selecting elements with `getElementById` and updating text via **`.textContent`**
* Using simple **state variables** (`sumHome`, `sumGuest`) to track scores
* Creating small **functions** for button actions (`addOneHome`, `addTwoGuest`, etc.)
* Implementing a **reset** flow that clears both scores
* Basic **layout with Flexbox** (central alignment, spacing, and grouping)
* Loading a **custom font** with `@font-face` (**Cursed Timer**) and combining it with **Google Fonts** for headings
* Applying **box-shadow**, hover states, and consistent spacing to match the design

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I’m reinforcing my **frontend fundamentals** — focusing on **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project helped me practice direct **DOM updates**, small function design, and keeping the UI clean and readable while following a Figma file closely.

If you’d like to **give feedback or a quick code review**, I’d love to hear it. 🙌
